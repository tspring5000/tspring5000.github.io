## 📌 On the Side
**Mobile Apps**\
Recently I've been working on a synthesiser app for iOS and an experimental sleep app using Flutter.
This has even taken me so far as learning Arduino as a prototyping platform

**Game Dev**\
Game dev has been a side project for me since I started learning programming, 
and I've been working on a large side project for a few years now. My tech stack consists of Godot and Aseprite right now, 
but in the past I've used everything from Unity to Blender to PICO-8 and even a few frameworks such as Bevy (Rust). 
As I work solo most of the time, I'm always having to pick up new skills aside from programming, 
including art and music as well as project and time management

**Music**\
Branching off from a need for game dev to its own hobby entirely, 
I also make music as a side project. Right now I'm trying out live coding, such as Glicol, 
for a programmatic approach to composition
