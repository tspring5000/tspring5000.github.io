## On the Side
**Game Dev**\
I spend much of my free time on game development, from small game jams over the weekend to large multi-year projects. My usual tooling consists of Godot, Blender and Aesprite, however in the past I've used Unity and PICO-8, and I've also tried a few frameworks such as Bevy, Raylib and WASM-4. I'm particularly interested in procedural generation and creative coding.

**Music**\
Due to working on so many solo game dev projects, I developed a need to make music for my games, which soon branched off into a hobby entirely of its own. Currently I'm trying out Glicol, a programmatic approach to building synths and composing music.
