    <h2>ðŸ“Œ On the Side</h2>
    <p><strong>Mobile Apps: </strong>
        I previously launched a synthesiser app for iOS called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/nonatone/id6502920821">Nonatone</a>, which has been very well received. <br>
        I have also been working on an experimental sleep app using Flutter, which has even taken me so far as learning Arduino as a prototyping platform
    </p>
    <p><strong>Game Development: </strong>Game dev has been a side project for me since I started learning programming, 
        and I've been working on a large side project for a few years now. My tech stack consists of Godot and Aseprite right now, 
        but in the past I've used everything from Unity to Blender to PICO-8 and even a few frameworks such as Bevy (Rust). 
        As I work solo most of the time, I'm always having to pick up new skills aside from programming, 
        including art and music as well as project and time management
    </p>
    <p><strong>Music: </strong>Branching off from a need for game dev to its own hobby entirely, 
        I also make music as a side project. Right now I'm trying out live coding, such as Glicol, 
        for a programmatic approach to composition
