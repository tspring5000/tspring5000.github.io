        <p><strong>Game Dev</strong></p>
        <p>
            I spend much of my free time on game development, from small game jams over the weekend to large multi-year projects. My usual tooling consists of Godot, Blender and 
            Aesprite, however in the past I've used Unity and PICO-8, and I've also tried a few frameworks such as Bevy, Raylib and WASM-4. I'm particularly interested in 
            procedural generation and creative coding.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Music</strong></p>
        <p>
            Due to working on so many solo game dev projects, I developed a need to make music for my games, which soon branched off into a hobby entirely of its own. Currently I'm trying 
            out Glicol, a programmatic approach to building synths and composing music.
